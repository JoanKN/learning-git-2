        <p>Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind</p>
        <p>Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind</p>
        <p>Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying</p>
        <p>But I'm only human after all</p>

        <p>Don't put your blame on me</p>
        <p>Don't put your blame on me</p>
        <p>Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?</p>
        <p>Do you see it clearer, or are you deceived </p>
        <p>In what you believe?</p>
        <p>Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?</p>
        <p>'Cause I'm only human after all</p>
        <p>You're only human after all</p>
        <p>Don't put the blame on me</p>
